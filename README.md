## How it Works ?
The bot checks for mentions from users. From the mentioned tweet the bot takes the conversation id of the entire thread. Conversation id is same for tweets in a particular thread. Then using conversation id we get the entire thread and avoid the replies from other users so as to get the tweets from the tweet author only . Then those threads will be send as DMs to corresponding user who tagged the bot.
